# Calligraphy Cut Challenge

A modern web application for showcasing and working with Calligraphy Cut styles and techniques. This project demonstrates a full-stack implementation with React frontend and Python backend, fully containerized with Docker.

## üöÄ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **Vite** - Next generation frontend tooling
- **React** - UI component library
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework

### Backend
- **Python** - Core programming language
- **FastAPI** - Modern, fast web framework for API development
- **GROQ API** - Integration for AI-powered text processing

### Infrastructure
- **Docker** - Containerization for consistent environments
- **Docker Compose** - Multi-container orchestration

### Important Note
**Groq API was used instead of OPENAI's API KEY because the former is entirely for free and was better for demonstration purposes but the same method is used for connecting any of them**

## üì¶ Installation

Choose from three installation methods:

### 1. Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started with zero configuration:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calligraphy-cut-challenge.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd calligraphy-cut-challenge

# Create .env file for GROQ API key (in backend directory)
echo "GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > backend/.env

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

The application will be available at:
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend API: http://localhost:8001

### 2. Direct Clone & Manual Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/calligraphy-cut-challenge.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd calligraphy-cut-challenge

# Frontend setup
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm dev

# In another terminal, backend setup
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

### 3. HTTP Download

1. Download the ZIP file from the repository
2. Extract to your preferred location
3. Follow the manual setup instructions above

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory with:

```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

You can get a GROQ API key from [groq.com](https://groq.com).

## üìö Usage

- Access the web interface at http://localhost:5173
- API documentation available at http://localhost:8001/docs
- Interact with the UI to explore Calligraphy Cut styles and techniques
